## 1. Introduction  
With the advent of Generative AI chatbots built on the LLM (Large Language Model), users have been able to get more personalized conversations and corresponding information, but it comes with some limitations.

- Knowledge Cutoff: I can't answer data generated after model training because I can't learn (not include newly created information)
- No access to private data: Inaccessible to confidential, personal, and non-public information inside the company.
- Hallucinations: Hallucinations develop hallucinogenic symptoms that make unsubstantiated answers plausible and natural.
- General Purpose: You can answer more than a certain level in many ways, but there are limitations such as **lack of expertise in a specific area**.

This project is a project to advance AI interview services, with a particular focus on advancing user response evaluation. Rather than evaluating based solely on LLM, it ultimately aims to **'improve the performance of the user's answer capability evaluation result'** by introducing the RAG method and providing more specific domains and more information to LLM.

**This allows us to provide services to help users prepare for interviews more effectively.**
